The ISYS1118 Software Engineering Fundamentals assessment involves writing a written report and submitting code for individual assignment. The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the student's understanding and application of software engineering principles. The assessment will assess the student's ability to explain and apply the main aspects of software engineering, evaluate requirements for a software system, recognize and describe current trends in the area of software engineering, and design and carry out tests using various testing techniques and tools. The code should follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology.

The assessment involves two main activities, the first of which involves implementing the functionality of the addStudentCourse() method in the Course class based on a set of constraints and then writing tests for it. The second activity involves creating two user stories with accompanying acceptance criteria, one based on GWT (Given-When-Then) and the other based on a rule-oriented approach.

In the final activity, the student must explain the concept of verification and validation using one example each based on the code from activities 1-2.
